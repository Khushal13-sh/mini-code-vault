 *
 * ðŸ“˜ Description:
 * You are given an array `tickets`, where each value at index i represents how many tickets the person at position i wants to buy.
 * Each person can only buy one ticket at a time and then goes to the back of the line.
 * Return the total time it takes for the person at index k to buy all their tickets.
 *
 * ðŸ§ª Example:
 * Input: tickets = [2, 3, 2], k = 2
 * Output: 6
