/**
 * Problem Title: Destination City
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * 
 * âœ… Problem Description:
 * You are given the array 'paths', where paths[i] = [cityA, cityB] means 
 * there exists a direct path going from cityA to cityB. 
 * 
 * You need to return the **destination city**, which is the city that 
 * does not have any outgoing path to another city.
 * 
 * ðŸ“¥ Example 1:
 * Input: paths = [["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]
 * Output: "Sao Paulo"
 * Explanation:
 * - The path is: "London" -> "New York" -> "Lima" -> "Sao Paulo".
 * - The destination city is "Sao Paulo" because it has no outgoing path.
 * 
 * ðŸ“¥ Example 2:
 * Input: paths = [["B","C"],["D","B"],["C","A"]]
 * Output: "A"
 * Explanation:
 * - The path is: "D" -> "B" -> "C" -> "A".
 * - The destination city is "A".
 * 
 * ðŸ“¥ Example 3:
 * Input: paths = [["A","Z"]]
 * Output: "Z"
 * Explanation:
 * - The path is: "A" -> "Z".
 * - The destination city is "Z".
 * 
 * ðŸ“Œ Constraints:
 * - 1 <= paths.length <= 100
 * - paths[i].length == 2
 * - 1 <= cityA.length, cityB.length <= 10
 * - cityA != cityB
 * - All strings consist of lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces.
