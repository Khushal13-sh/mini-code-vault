/**
 * Problem Title: Distance Between Bus Stops
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * 
 * âœ… Problem Description:
 * A bus has n stops numbered from 0 to n - 1 that form a circle.
 * The distance array represents the distance between consecutive stops.
 * The bus can travel in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.
 * 
 * ðŸ’¡ Task:
 * Return the shortest distance between the given start and destination stops.
 * 
 * ðŸ“¥ Example 1:
 * Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 1
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: Distance between 0 and 1 is 1 or 9, minimum is 1.
 * 
 * ðŸ“¥ Example 2:
 * Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 2
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Distance between 0 and 2 is 3 or 7, minimum is 3.
 * 
 * ðŸ“¥ Example 3:
 * Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 3
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Distance between 0 and 3 is 6 or 4, minimum is 4.
 * 
 * ðŸ“Œ Constraints:
 * - 1 <= n <= 10^4
 * - distance.length == n
 * - 0 <= start, destination < n
 * - 0 <= distance[i] <= 10^4

     * ðŸ§  Logic:
     * 1. Normalize start and destination to ensure start <= destination.
     * 2. Calculate clockwise distance by summing from start to destination.
     * 3. Calculate total distance by summing all distances.
     * 4. Counterclockwise distance = totalDistance - clockwiseDistance.
     * 5. Return the minimum of clockwise and counterclockwise distances.
