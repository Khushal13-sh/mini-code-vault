/**
 * Problem Title: Min Cost Climbing Stairs
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * 
 * âœ… Problem Description:
 * You are given an integer array 'cost' where cost[i] represents the cost of 
 * the ith step on a staircase. After paying the cost, you can either:
 * - Climb 1 step
 * - Climb 2 steps
 * 
 * You can start either from step 0 or step 1.
 * Your goal is to find the **minimum cost to reach the top** of the floor.
 * 
 * ðŸ“¥ Example 1:
 * Input:  cost = [10,15,20]
 * Output: 15
 * Explanation:
 * - Start at index 1, pay 15, and jump two steps to the top.
 * 
 * ðŸ“¥ Example 2:
 * Input:  cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation:
 * - Start at index 0.
 * - Pay 1 and move two steps (index 2).
 * - Pay 1 and move two steps (index 4).
 * - Pay 1 and move two steps (index 6).
 * - Pay 1 and move one step (index 7).
 * - Pay 1 and move two steps (index 9).
 * - Pay 1 and move one step to the top.
 * - Total cost: 6.
 * 
 * ðŸ“Œ Constraints:
 * - 2 <= cost.length <= 1000
 * - 0 <= cost[i] <= 999

     * - Start calculating from the 2nd step and update the minimum cost at each step.
     * - Return the minimum cost to reach the top.
