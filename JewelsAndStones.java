/**
 * Problem Title: Jewels and Stones
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * 
 * âœ… Problem Description:
 * You're given two strings:
 * - 'jewels' â†’ represents the types of stones that are jewels
 * - 'stones' â†’ represents the stones you have
 * 
 * Each character in 'stones' is a type of stone you possess.
 * You need to count how many of those are also jewels.
 * 
 * ðŸ”¹ Important:
 * - Letters are **case-sensitive** (i.e., 'a' â‰  'A')
 * 
 * ðŸ“¥ Example 1:
 * Input:  jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: You have 3 jewels â†’ 'a', 'A', 'A'
 * 
 * ðŸ“¥ Example 2:
 * Input:  jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * ðŸ“Œ Constraints:
 * - 1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
 * - Both strings contain only English letters
 * - All characters in 'jewels' are unique
